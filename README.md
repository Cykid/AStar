# [C++] A* Class
A simple class collection to realize pathfinding.

## Status
The collection is currently under development. Important functions such as converting 2D arrays into pathfinding grids are still missing, as well as the implementation in a single class.

## ToDo:

 - Wrap code into one class
 - Situation-dependent heuristic
 - Algorithm optimization
 - 2D Array into grid 
 - Memoryleak fixing
 
 ## Features
- If there is a way, it will be found
- Optionally, diagonal pathfinding can be allowed

## Thanks to
